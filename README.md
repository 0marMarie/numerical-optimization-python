# 🚀 Numerical Optimization using `Python`


> Numerical Optimization is one of the central techniques in Machine Learning

> This repo is my implementation to various numerical optimization algorithms from `scratch` in `python` 

## ⚙️ Getting Started

> Just clone or download the repo and make that you have `python installed` (`Recommend in a virtual env`) then `install` :

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn

Make sure that datasets are in the same directory: 

* MultipleLR.csv
* RegData.csv
